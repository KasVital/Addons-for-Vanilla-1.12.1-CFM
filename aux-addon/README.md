# This is experimental.
Modified version of aux that shares scan data through LFT chat on the turtle wow server.  
Whenever your addon updates a daily tooltip it will share price data that others can pick up.  
You can turn of data sharing (both sending and receiving it) with **/aux sharing**

#### Filter Builder
![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/8hilZc9.png)
While it is faster to type filters directly into the search box this sub-tab serves as a tutorial to learn how to formulate queries.
The filters on the left side are Blizzard filters which may reduce the number of pages to be scanned and those on the right side are post filters which do not affect the scan time but can be combined with logical operators to formulate very complex filters.
### Post
![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/otzOT2I.png)
- When entering prices **g**, **s** and **c** denote gold, silver and copper respectively.
- A price value without explicit denotations will count as gold. (e.g., 10.5 = 10g50s)
- Price values can contain decimals. (e.g., 1.5g = 1g50s)
- Right-clicking an item in the inventory listing will start a search.
- Right-clicking a bag item will select it in the listing.
- In the listing of bids/buyouts a red price is undercutting stack/unit price.
- Clicking an entry in the in the listings of bids/buyouts of existing auctions will undercut with your bid stack/buyout unit price.
- Double-click in the bids/buyouts listings will also match the stack size.

## Search Filters
AddOns do not have any additional Blizzard filters available to them beyond the ones in the default auction house interface, nor do they have any other ways to combine them.
Of course it is possible for an addOn to apply arbitrary filters after the Blizzard query but only the Blizzard query will affect the number of pages to be scanned and thus the time it takes for a scan.
Since the Vanilla API will only let you request a page every 4 seconds having no Blizzard query in your filter can lead to very long scan times.

aux queries are separated by semicolons and always contain exactly one Blizzard query. The Blizzard query may be empty, i.e., all pages are scanned, which can be useful for collecting historical data.
The real time mode only supports empty Blizzard queries.
Semicolons always mean "or", i.e., **q1;q2;q3** means all items matching **q1** or **q2** or **q3** will be listed.

The parts of individual queries are separated by slashes, e.g., **q1p1/q1p2;q2p1/q2p2/q2p3**. All parts either belong to the Blizzard filter or the post processing filter.

Blizzard filters can be created through the form on the left side of the "New Filter" sub-tab of the "Search" tab or typed directly into the search box.
For learning to write queries you can fill in the form, add the query to the search box with the "Add" or "Replace" buttons and inspect the generated output until you feel comfortable typing them out yourself.
For the most part it should be rather intuitive.
The first part is special in that if it doesn't match any specific filter keyword it will be treated as a Blizzard name search. E.g., a query consisting only of **felcloth** would list the items Felcloth, Pattern: Felcloth Hood, Felcloth Bag etc.
Usually you would want to use the **exact** modifier which only matches auctions where the name, apart from case, exactly equals the first part of the query.
**exact** is the only modifier which is part Blizzard and part post filter, though it is mostly treated as a Blizzard filter. **exact** will tailor the Blizzard query as well as possible towards the item searched (level range, item class/subclass/slot, quality ...) and it cannot be used together with Blizzard filters for these properties.

Post processing filters are more flexible.
They are specified using the filter primitives you find on the right side of the "New Filter" sub-tab and can be combined with **and**, **or** and **not** using polish notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation).
Filter parts other than the first which don't match any specific filter, just like the first part is treated as a Blizzard name filter, are treated as a tooltip filter.
For using a tooltip filter as the first filter part there is an explicit **tooltip** modifier.

Here are some queries I use myself for illustration:

**or/and2/profit/5g/percent/60/and3/bid-profit/5g/bid-percent/60/left/30m**<br/>
This filter will search the whole auction house for auctions either with a buyout price of 5g or more below market value and 60% or less of the market value or a bid price for which the same is true and in addition only 30m or less remaining.

**wrangler's wristbands/exact/or2/and2/+3 agility/+3 stamina/+5 stamina/price/1g**<br/>
This will search for wrangler's wristband with 3/3 monkey or 5 stam suffixes for at most 1g buyout price.

**recipe/usable/not/libram**<br/>
This will scan for usable recipes and exclude those with "libram" in the tooltip (i.e., librams)

**armor/cloth/50/intellect/stamina**<br/>
This will scan the auction house for cloth armor which has a requirement of at least lvl 50 as well both intellect and stamina stats.

## Historical Value

aux condenses the prices you've scanned during a day (midnight to midnight) into a single value, similarly to retail Auctioneer's "stat-simple" module.
This daily value is calculated as the minimum buyout of the day which in practice gives a similar enough value to that of retail TSM while using much less memory.
Limiting the memory usage is important because like Auctioneer and unlike TSM aux is using a day based instead of scan based interval and thus has to store the daily progress in the savedvariables.
Finally these daily values are collected in a list of the last 11 of them from which the market value is taken as the median. The values are weighted by their age but it doesn't have a large effect unless they're older than a month.

The bottom line is that you get a fairly accurate market value for both very active markets as well as rarer items that has a reasonably short reaction time to market changes, recovers easily and never needs to be reset while still being reasonably stable and hard to manipulate and dealing with outliers very well, not getting distorted by multiple scans per day, not needing a single full scan per day but instead naturally picking up every price you scan while going about your usual business, letting you focus on a certain part of the auction house by scanning only that part regularly and avoiding information overload by giving you a single concise value for the tooltip.
