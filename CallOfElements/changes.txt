v2.7
ADDITIONS:
-save positions
-ruRU localization

v2.6

ADDITIONS:

- Korean localization
  LeeEui-ho recently sent me the Korean translation and thus completed the
  currently supported languages (at least until WoW is available in Spain as well ;-) )
  
CHANGES:

- Performance upgrade
  There were some major memory leaks and COE consumed too much overall processor
  time. I changed the way the element frames are updated and now they should no
  longer use up a noticeable amount of memory and call the update routines only
  when really necessary.
  
FIXES:

- Disappearing element frames
  Whenever the totems were reloaded in "Timers Only" mode, depending on the currently
  active totems, a totem frame could have disappeared and would only show up again when 
  throwing a totem of the same element from your spellbook.
  This has been fixed and the timers will now reset properly when your totems are reloaded.
  Note that this means, that you will lose active timers upon zoning but in most cases
  you wouldn't need them anymore anyway.

=============================================================================================

v2.5

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Please use http://coe.wyverex-cave.net/ for further bug reports and suggestions.
Thank you

ADDITIONS:

- Chinese (simplified) localization
  Thanks to windger a chinese translation is available as well.
  Note though, that I have no way to test if it is correct or if it even
  works at all! Please drop a comment at http://coe.wyverex-cave.net/ if
  there are any issues
  
- Totems sets for named targets
  Whenever you target a hostile unit, COE will now check if there is a
  custom set with this unit's name available. If it finds one, that set
  is activated. That also takes precedence over the PVP sets.
  NOTE: The check is case-sensitive, so make sure you spell the name right.
  
- Tremor totem advisor
  Added Druid's Slumber (need translations, though)
  
- Change anchor totem with CTRL
  When pressing the CTRL-key while clicking a totem button, this totem replaces
  the anchor totem for this element if it isn't already the anchor totem and
  you have the Customize or Active Set mode activated. Furthermore, in Active Set
  mode, it will also make the clicked totem part of the current set.

CHANGES:

- Prevent trinket pickup
  You can no longer pickup the trinket by shift-dragging the totem button.
  This didn't work in 2.4 and wasn't meant to be available anyway, since
  the trinket doesn't have spell slot like a totem.
  
- Removed set restart modifier key
  Until 2.4 you could assign a modifier key to automatically restart a set
  while clicking a totem and pressing that key. This feature didn't work well
  in most cases and it's also quite uselesse since you can also create a
  /coe restartset macro (and most players already do this).
  
- When expanding a flex bar by mousing over it, currently docked totems 
  (i.e. active or advised totems or those in cooldown) will now show first
  independent of their actual ordering. This makes it possible to mouse over
  a docked totem and click it right away. Before, if the docked totem had a
  high ordering, it would suddenly change its position when opening the bar
  and you had to move the mouse again.

FIXES:

- /coe restartset
  Due to a change in the last release this command didn't work anymore
  This has been fixed
  

=============================================================================================

v2.4

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Please use http://coe.wyverex-cave.net/ for further bug reports and suggestions.
Thank you

ADDITIONS:

- Added trinket support
  The Enamored Water Spirit trinket is now supported as part of the water element bar.
  It behaves just like any other totem with the exception that you have to equip the
  trinket to actually make it usable. Note that the trinket button will always show
  up in the water element bar as long as you possess at least one water totem
  but you can choose to make it invisible like any other totem until you got the trinket.
  
- French localization
  Thanks to mcoaua a french localization is finally available now and will be continued
  in further releases
  Also thanks to Foussa for previous efforts
  

CHANGES:

- Lag-dependent timer activation
  In order to decide whether to really activate a totem timer after trying to
  throw a totem, COE will now take the current network lag value into account. 
  Timers would not activate properly with lag values of 1000ms or more before.
  This should now work as expected
  
- Still active totem timers will now reset when you die


FIXES:

- When in Customize mode, a set element would not be properly reset after expiration, 
  if it was a dynamic button (i.e. when inactive only showing up when mousing over the bar).
  First when opening the bar again, COE would notice that this element in the current
  set had already expired and should be thrown again.
  This has been fixed

- When switching totem sets, sometimes only the currently active totems would be thrown
  again when issuing the next throwset command. This has been fixed
  
- When switching totem sets using the Customization Dialog, the currently active set
  was not reset. The current set will now reset upon switching
  
- When switching from Customize to Timers Only or Active Set mode while totems were
  active, sometimes an active totem showed up twice in its bar afterwards. This will
  no longer happen
  
- The healing module didn't do anything in the german version because the healing spell
  localizations were wrong. This has been fixed

=============================================================================================

v2.3

ADDITIONS:

- The "/coe priorset" command lets you cycle backwards through your configured sets now
  
- Added the option to show the active timers ONLY in the separate timer frame
  Note that this means you get no timers at all if you choose to disable the timer frame
  

CHANGES:

- When the "Autoswitch sets in PVP" option is enabled, COE will automatically switch
  back to the last active non-pvp set upon targeting an enemy mob
  This should make switching between PVP and PVE more convenient
  
- COE should no longer try to heal dead or offline targets


FIXES:

- Fixed the german timers. Yes, really :)

- Fixed another one of those niggling typos with the disease totem advisor

- On some systems there was a COE_TotemData:485 nil error
  Since this error never appeared on my own system I cannot tell for sure but
  it should be more unlikely now that this error appears again.
  If it should, please drop a comment for me

=============================================================================================

v2.2

NOTES:
- This is merely a hotfix for 1.10 and is taken right out of development
  Chances are that you encounter some problems related to the healing module.
  Also, there are features missing I promised for the next release and the
  french localization is also not included yet.
  But I guess for everyone of you it is more important that COE works again
  than getting the new features :) 

ADDITIONS:

- Added a basic healing module
  A very basic form of healing module has finally found its way into COE.
  There are two healing modes that you can trigger by assigning a key binding
  in your key bindings dialog.
  BATTLE HEAL
  	When hitting the battle heal key, COE will target the party member with the
	lowest health ratio and heal him with the most appropriate spell using as 
	less casting time as possible (which always results in using the Lesser
	Healing Wave actually)
	It will only use the rank it really needs and thus helps conserving mana
	
  BEST HEAL
    Works just like battle heal but also uses the Healing Wave if it has a better
	mana/effect efficiency. So, outside of combat, use best heal and when in combat
	use battle heal if healing must be quick or you are in danger of losing casting time
	
  NOTE
    I am totally aware that the chain heal and effects like Nature's Swiftness
	are not taken into account yet. This primarily results of the fact that I don't
	possess any of those spells with my shaman yet. Furthermore I don't have an idea
	yet when to use the chain heal in an automated way. 
	I am grateful for every kind of input regarding possible options and enhancements
	to the healing module.
	Just drop a comment at http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=2126 or
	http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=3407
	

FIXES:

- Fixed COE for 1.10
  As far as I have tested, COE should now work properly with patch 1.10
  Fortunately, Blizzard didn't prevent any of the functions COE uses from
  being called in contrast to some unlucky mods out there...

- German timers
  Hopefully, the german timers should now display the correct totem durations
  Drop a comment for me if not

=============================================================================================

v2.11

FIXES:

- COE_TotemVisual:167 nil error
  Errors in the COE_DisplayedTotems structure will now mostly be
  fixed when entering the game. This should eliminate that niggling
  error.
  I have still no clue, why it happens in the first place, though.
  I have ideas but nothing that really explains it.
  Basically it seems that the error occurs only when training a totem
  skill and don't already possess the corresponding totem.
  
  If you get that error again, you can either relog or reset the
  whole totem ordering with the "/coe resetordering" command

=============================================================================================

v2.1

NOTES:

- Thanks to Foussa of Hyjal, a french translation is in progress
  and will hopefully be available soon

ADDITIONS:

- Rank 1 totems
  You can now define a key modifier that throws the rank 1 totem
  instead of the maximum rank when you click on a totem button. 
  Possible modifiers are Shift, Alt and Ctrl
  
- Added slash command "/coe reload"
  This command does the same as the button in the configuration dialog,
  i.e. it reloads all totems and sets
  
- Added slash command "/coe reset"
  Resets all currently active timers and sets. While "/coe restartset"
  only resets the active set so you can throw the same totems again,
  "/coe reset" will also deactivate all active timers, i.e. you won't
  be notified when still active totems expire
  
- Added slash command "/coe resetframes"
  Returns all element bars to the screen center. This is quite handy
  if you somehow accidentally moved one of your bars out of the screen
  
- Added bar grouping
  Upon enabling the "Move bars as group" option, all element bars will
  retain their relative positions when you drag one of them
  I know you've all desperately waited for this one :)
  
- Spell pickup
  When dragging a totem button with the Shift key held down, you will
  pickup the spell instead and can drag it to one of your standard
  action buttons
  If you hold down the Ctrl key additionally, you will pick up the
  corresponding rank 1 totem
  

CHANGES:

- When configuring the active set in "Active Set" bar mode, the active 
  totem of an element is now immediately made the first totem when you 
  click it. In v2.0 this was done only when you exited the configuration 
  mode and that caused a little confusion
  
- Advisor pet scanning
  The totem advisor now also scans your party member's pets for debuffs
  that can be cured by one of your totems 

- When the next totem that would be thrown in your active set is still
  in cooldown, COE will skip to the next totem of the active set instead
  of giving a "Spell not ready yet" error message
  
- All messages from COE in the chat frame will now begin with [COE] and
  will have their own color
  

FIXES:

- When setting the scale to the maximum of 1.2, opening the configuration
  dialog decreased the scale by 0.01 up to a somehow arbitrary maximum
  value where the scale rested then
  This has been fixed

- When you didn't have all totem elements yet, the empty element bars
  were nevertheless "visible" and prevented interaction with game elements
  behind them. Empty bars will now be invisible
  
- Sometimes an expiring totem gave a nil-error message when also using the
  separate timer frame. This should be fixed now


=============================================================================================

v2.0

CHANGES:

- I separated the visual and logical parts of the totem module and rewrote the 
  whole visual part. It now has much more customization options than before.
  Each element now has its own totem bar and each totem bar is fully customizable
  on its own. The former "Display Mode" now controls which totem is shown in the 
  "anchor button" of each totem bar, which is either your choice ("Customize"),
  the (last) active totem ("Timers Only") or the member of the active set ("Active Set").
   
  The bar extends from the anchor button in the direction you choose (Up, Down, Left, Right).
  Furthermore, with the bar mode you can control whether only the anchor button ("Closed")
  or all configured totems ("Open") should be shown. If you choose the "Flex" mode, only
  the anchor button is shown until you mouse over it which will temporarily show all
  other totems as well and hide them again after a short delay when the mouse leaves.
  By setting the static button count to a value of greater than one, you can also have
  a mix of the "Open" and the "Flex" mode, showing a number of totems by default and the
  rest when mousing over.
  Finally, you can also hide the whole element bar by setting "Hidden" as the bar mode.
  
  Note, that you can still adjust which totems each element bar possesses and in which
  order they appear. The anchor totem is always shown, though, thus removing it from the
  bar while in "Configure Bar" mode has no effect as long as it is the anchor totem.
  The configured totem order is retained whenever possible, that is, when a totem becomes the
  anchor totem, e.g. by switching the active set in "Active Set" mode, it is now the first
  totem in the bar but all other totems retain their relative ordering.
  
  Also note that while in "Flex" or "Closed" mode, active and advised totems and totems
  with an active cooldown will be temporarily shown just as if you were mousing over the bar.

- Made the configuration dialog draggable with the mouse  


ADDITIONS:

- You can now activate a separate timer window that only shows totems that are currently active
  and drag it where you want it on your screen. I added this feature because I noticed that
  although having the timers in the bar and the notifications on the screen, it can happen in 
  instances that you lose track of your active totems. By dragging the timer frame somewhere
  to your screen center you just need a quick look to see how long each of your totems will
  be active.
  In the configuration dialog you can choose the totem alignment (2x2 Box, Vertical, Horizontal).
  
- COE now has a scaling bar separate from the rest of your UI so that you can adjust the totem
  bar sizes to your likings. The default value of 1.0 means COE scales just as the rest of your
  UI does.

FIXES:

- Fixed a typo in the advisor output for the Disease Cleansing Totem  
  
=============================================================================================

v1.82

NOTE:

- When assigning a new talent point you should reload the totems in the
  configuration dialog if this talent changed mana cost or totem durations.
  There is no way to know ingame when you assign a talent point so you
  have to do this manually.
  When you log in next time, reload your interface or learn a new skill, 
  the changes are automatically updated, though.

FIXES:

- Throwing the mana tide totem resulted in an error since the introduction of the
  cooldown timers. This should be fixed now
  
- Fixed a typo in the disease totem advisor
  The advisor should now correctly suggest throwing the Disease Cleansing Totem
  
- Fixed some more issues with the German localization
  All totems should now properly keep track of their health and notify you when
  they are destroyed by enemies
  

=============================================================================================

v1.81

FIXES:

- Hotfix for non-shaman classes
  I accidentally made the totem bar visible for other classes in the last release

=============================================================================================

v1.8

ADDITIONS:

- Totems with a cooldown now display it in red digits when their timer is
  no longer active but they are still cooling down. 
  This should give you more exact information on when you can cast the
  totem again than the default cooldown texture. For better readability
  I also removed the cooldown texture for those totems

- You now can restart casting of the active set at any time while in the previous
  version you could only throw the set again when one or all of its totems
  had already timed out.
  Either assign a key binding or create a macro with the command "/coe restartset"
  or assign a "Restart set modifier" in the configuration dialog. If you press
  this modifier key while attempting to throw the active set, it will first restart
  the set.
  Note, that this only really works if you click a throwset macro or have the key
  binding on your mouse because WOW thinks that the modifier you pressed belongs
  to the key binding you want to execute. So if you bound throwing the active set to
  your T key for example, you won't be able to restart the set by assigning the ALT
  modifier and pressing ALT+T because WOW thinks you want to execute the ALT+T key binding.
  Don't know if there is any way to bypass this yet.

CHANGES:

- Removed the totem bar backdrop and the config button
  I guess most users didn't use the button anyway and the always
  popping in backdrop got on people's nerves :)
  You can now drag the totem bar by dragging any of the totem buttons
  
- Put the totem bar on a lower frame layer to minimize impact on mods
  which rely on getting themselves on top of the rest like bag mods, for example
  
- The totem advisor no longer checks the raid group for debuffs now.
  Since totems only have an effect on members of your party and not the
  whole raid as I initially supposed, it is just wasted time and misleading
  to check the raid as well
  
FIXES:

- Fixed a bug with the key binding display on the totem buttons.
  All totem buttons should now display their appropriate key binding

- While in "Active Set" mode and configuring the active set, the red
  borders around the set totems didn't show. This has been fixed
  
- There seemed to be a typo bug in the SavedVariables repair function of v1.7
  Your saved variables will be once again repaired when your first load v1.8
  
- The mana costs of different ranks of the same totem were not read properly and
  thus the totem bar sometimes showed a "usable" totem while the player still
  didn't have enough mana. This has been fixed 

- Fixed some issues with the German localization

=============================================================================================

v1.7

- Added an option to fix the totem bar position to prevent dragging it accidentally

- The shell command "/coe list" now shows all available shell commands

- In the German version the default totem set and the class sets could not be thrown
  due to a localization bug. Also the cast order was not localized.
  This has been fixed. Your saved variables should be fixed automatically when first
  loading v1.7
  Thanks to Shinzhu for pointing me in the right direction
  
- In "Customize" display mode, the totem order is now customizable for each 
  element separately. Just click on the "Configure Order" button and swap two
  totems of the same element by clicking them one after the other. You cannot
  swap totems of different elements, though, and this won't be implemented in
  a further release because that would break the whole structure of the mod,
  so don't bother asking :)
  Note, that upon first loading v1.7 all totems appear in reverse order due to
  an internal change in the ordering data structures
  
- In "Customize"/"Horizontal" and "Customize"/"Vertical" display modes, a small
  gap is inserted between totems of different elements to group them visually


=============================================================================================

v1.6

- Added some more spells for the tremor totem advisor
  Still need the german translations though

- The totem frame should now have the proper width when not all totems are
  shown in "Customize"/"Box" mode
  
- Added the "Disabled" option in the "Tooltip Alignment" drop down menu.
  This disables the tooltips for the totem buttons
  
- The currently active set did no longer show the red borders in the totem bar
  This has been fixed
  
- When disabling autoswitching sets in PVP, configuration did not work properly
  This has been fixed

=============================================================================================

v1.5

- "All Totems" mode has been renamed to "Customize" mode.
  You can now customize which totems should be displayed in "Customize" mode
  To start configuration click the "Configure Bar" button in the config dialog.
  Configuration works exactly like the totem set configuration. Each totem that
  should be visible has a green border while configuring.

- Totem button alignment now also works in "Customize" mode. You can align the
  buttons either in a box, where totems of one element occupy a single row, or
  you can display all totems horizontally or vertically
  
- By adding the seventh air totem in the last patch I accidentally removed the
  sixth water totem :)
  The "COE_Totem.lua:199" error should be fixed now

=============================================================================================

v1.4

- Added a seventh air totem button. Must have missed this one before. 
  COE should now load properly when having all seven air totems
